Voronoi Health Analytics specializes in AI-based medical image analysis software, focusing on their Data Analysis Facilitation Suite (DAFS). DAFS is designed for automated analysis of CT and PET/CT images, offering powerful tools for body composition, organ, and tissue measurements. The software is 100% on-premise, ensuring data privacy and security. It is widely used in research institutes for applications in oncology, cardiac health, and clinical trials.

To enhance the efficiency of medical image analysis using the DAFS software, I developed an AI chatbot that converts a doctor's plain English requests into a JSON format containing region of interest (ROI) and slab details. This JSON is then parsed by DAFS to generate the analysis report, streamlining the process. This solution eliminates the need for doctors to memorize or constantly reference documentation, saving them valuable time that can be used to save lives.
